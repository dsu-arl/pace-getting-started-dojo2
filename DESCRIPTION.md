Welcome to pwn.college! This is your first "dojo".
Each dojo will teach you a different topic.
Within each dojo, there will be "modules" that break down a topic into smaller, more manageable goals.
And finally, each module will have "challenges" for you to complete. 
Each challenge you successfully finish will grant you a flag! 
Flags are used to track your progress as you complete challenges/modules/dojos.
Open the "Start Here" module to get started!

This addition is only added to the `update-test` branch.
