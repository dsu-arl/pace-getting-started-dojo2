## Challenge Description
You can also make your own files!
The pre-made files that belong to each challenge are stored in the `/challenge` directory.
Files that *you* make should typically be stored in your "home" directory (`/home/hacker`).

There are several different types of files you can make. You may have experience with `.docx` (Microsoft Word) files or `.pptx` (PowerPoint) files. 
Some other types of files:
- `.txt` (text) files hold plain text (no images, no formatting)
- `.c` files hold C code
- `.py` files hold python code

To make your own text file in VSCode, click the `☰` button in the top left corner -> File -> New Text File. This will make a new text file that does not have any data stored in it. 
Then start typing! Try typing your name, "hello world!", or whatever you want.

Once you have some text in your file, you will need to save it. Press `CTRL+S` to save your file. 
VSCode will ask you what name to give the file, and it will usually give you a suggestion based on what you typed in the file. You can keep the suggested name, or replace it with your own. 

Note: Do not remove the `/home/hacker/` that comes before your file name. This tells VSCode that you want to save your file in your "home" directory. 

To solve this challenge, make a text file in your home directory called "myfile.txt" and save some text in it. Then run `/challenge/solve`, which will verify that you solved the challenge and print your flag.
## Challenge Steps
1. Start and open VSCode workspace
2. Make a new text file, and save text in it
3. Save this file with the name "myfile.txt"
4. Run `/challenge/solve` to receive your flag
